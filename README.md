# FizzBuzz Demo for workshop
This repository was created for a workshop that will show students how to approach a simple problem: The FizzBuzz Coding Challenge. The FizzBuzz coding problem is one of the most commonly asked interview questions because it has a very simple solution and is a great tool to figgure out how the programmer interviewed thinks about building a program. Albeit, under the pressure of getting a job. ;)
